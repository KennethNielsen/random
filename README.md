This repository contains small scripts that I have made for different
purposes that I thought may be useful for others. I have made no
effort to make them general, but they should reasonably well
commented, so they may serve as a starting point if someone needs to
solve the same problem.

Current scripts:

convert_rednote_to_elog
=======================

This folder contains to scripts to convert a laboratory logbook from
Red Notebook (http://rednotebook.sourceforge.net/) to elog
(https://midas.psi.ch/elog/). The short story is that in our lab we
needed a tool for electronic logbooks. The first tool we selected, Red
Notebook, although an excellent program, did not exactly meet our
needs and therefore, when we found elog we converted.

There are two scripts, one that tries to maintain the markup and
convert it to HTML and one that just takes the entire entry as clear
text.
